## SENTIMENT EXTRACTION FROM IMAGES USING LATENT FEATURES AND JOINT EMBEDDING APPROACH

This research study proposes a two-phase deep feature engineering framework for efficient learning of visual semantics. The underlying idea of using joint embedding with hidden textual features of text associated with a meme image and image captioning is assessed on the Memotion dataset. This ideates to identifying key terms using deep NLP models from the BERT family, Text Rank, or TF-IDF. Ranking scores for key terms are produced and then Word2Vec is used to generate the vector representation for each key term Wide ResNet50 and Sentence2Vec is also leveraged to extract and encode the meme category and captions embeddings. Finally, the tasks to classify sentiment and emotion type are executed with a simple ANN setup. The findings are compared with state-of-the-art results and reported.
